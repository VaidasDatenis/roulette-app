# Roulette App Project
# Finished - available for reviews!

Welcome to the Roulette App Project, a comprehensive Vue.js 3 application designed to simulate and interact with two distinct roulette tables: Single Zero and Double Zero. This app aims to provide users with an engaging experience, showcasing the dynamics of roulette gameplay, including real-time statistics, historical data, event, and action logs.

## Features

- **Two Roulette Tables**: Users can choose between Single Zero and Double Zero roulette tables, each with its unique layout and odds, offering a diverse gaming experience.
- **Live Statistics**: The app displays live statistics for both roulette tables, including the most frequently landed numbers (hot numbers) and those that are due to hit (cold numbers).
- **History Page**: A detailed history page is available, presenting the outcomes of previous spins for each roulette table, allowing users to track patterns or revisit past games.
- **Event and Action Logs**: The app captures and displays real-time event logs (e.g., spin results, number selections) and action logs (e.g., table switches, bet placements), enhancing transparency and user engagement.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js 3**: Utilized for its reactive core and composition API, offering a robust foundation for building the app's interactive features.
- **RxJS**: Employs reactive programming techniques for managing state and side effects, facilitating a clean and scalable codebase.
- **SCSS**: Leveraged for styling, allowing for modular and maintainable CSS with variables, mixins, and nested rules.
- **Jest**: Used for unit testing, ensuring the reliability and performance of the application through comprehensive test suites.
